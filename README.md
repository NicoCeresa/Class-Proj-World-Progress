# P1-World-Progress
In this project, you'll explore data from Gapminder.org, a website dedicated to providing a fact-based view of the world and how it has changed. That site includes several data visualizations and presentations, but also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.

The Gapminder website collects data from many sources and compiles them into tables that describe many countries around the world. All of the data they aggregate are published in the Systema Globalis. Their goal is "to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset." All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.

This project is dedicated to Hans Rosling (1948-2017), who championed the use of data to understand and prioritize global development challenges.
