# P1-World-Progress
In this project, I explored data from Gapminder.org
This project is dedicated to Hans Rosling (1948-2017), who championed the use of data to understand and prioritize global development challenges.
In this class project I explored how child mortality rates, life expectancy, and poverty has changed over time to get a better understanding of how the world has progressed over time
